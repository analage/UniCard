# UniCard
In East-West University, students and faculty are issued a CampusCard which provides access to the various facilities on campus; in addition, a card- user may use the card to buy meals from the campus wide Campus-Cafes. CampusCafes Inc maintains a number of restaurants/cafes and vending machines all over campus. A card user may use any of the cafes or vending machines to enter (and store) her/his choices, order food, know the calorie content and keep track of his/her expenses.
    CampusSmartCafe (CSC) is a computer-based application that is a simulation of how Campus Cafes work on East-West University campus. 
2.0	 Functionality
The functionality of the application is described briefly below:
2.1	 Display a Campus Map: Display a Campus map showing the location of the cafes, food stores and vending machines on campus.
2.2	 Select a café: A card-user selects a café by pointing and clicking on its location on the map. The selection opens up a window with options to buy/order food, enter preferences and/or view expenses.
2.3	Enter preferences: A user can enter food preferences and/or available funds.
Food preferences
Food preferences can range from daily caloric requirements/restrictions or preference for specific needs such as low sodium, low sugar items etc.
A user can enter the daily calorie intake that should be monitored. The user can also add any special diet requirements (for example, low Sodium, low calorie, low cholesterol etc) that should be monitored. The user’s preferences are saved and used to monitor the requirements as he/she buys food items. The saved preferences for a user are available from any restaurant or a vending machine (part of CSC network) on campus.
Available Funds
A user can enter an amount for the available funds (for a month, for example). Every time she/he buys a food item, the purchase amount is subtracted from the available funds.
2.4	View Dietary profile
A user can select to view his/her dietary profile. A dietary profile uses the food preferences (user preferences for number of calories per day, for example) entered earlier by the user. Whenever the user buys an item, the item’s calories are entered into the profile. The profile shows the user preference (for calories), number spent and the amount left.
For example, a user may set a daily caloric requirement to be between 2000-2200 calories. Every time a user buys a food item through CSC machines, the item calories are subtracted from the daily requirement and the number of calories left will be displayed.

2.5	View Expenses
A user can select to view his/her expense profile. An expense profile uses an amount for funds (by month) entered earlier by the user. 
Whenever the user buys an item, the funds are adjusted accordingly. A view of the expenses shows the current date, funds amount set for the month ($800 for example), money spent thus far and the balance of funds available. 
2.6	 Buy Food (via a vending machine)
Using the available food choices displayed on the vending machine, the user selects the item, inserts the card (or enters the card number and password) and the item is dispensed; the user’s caloric and expense profile is updated.
2.7	 Order food
Using the available cafes on campus, the user selects an item(s) from a specific cafe, inserts the card (or enters the card number and password) and a message is shown as to where and when the item would be ready for either pick-up or eat-in.  The user’s caloric and expense profile is updated.
